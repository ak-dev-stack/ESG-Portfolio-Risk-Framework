# ESG-Portfolio-Risk-Framework
A quantitative framework for commercial banking that automates Environmental &amp; Social (E&amp;S) risk screening and Action Plan (ESAP) tracking. Using synthetic South Asian loan data, this project transforms qualitative risk labels into numeric scores, visualizes portfolio concentration, and statistically validates Green Finance performance.
